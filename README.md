# 0.01-BTC-Puzzle-by-Corey-Phillips
A bit of Python code made to solve the '0.01 BTC Puzzle by Corey Phillips'

The recommended amount of RAM is 32GB, CPU is optional (scanning speed is directly proportional).

Using 8 cores with a Ryzen 9 7940HS, it scans approximately 100,000 possibilities per second.

This page is currently being created; I've left the source code as a text file which I am now developing (to reduce the amount of RAM used and to speed up the scanning process).

And frankly, I'm just starting to learn GitHub, so this process might take some time. Thank you for your patience.
